//! OpenClaw framework driver.
//!
//! OpenClaw plugin adapters use the CLI-managed registry: `enable` runs
//! `openclaw plugins install <resource_root>` then `plugins enable <plugin_id>`;
//! `disable` runs `openclaw plugins uninstall <plugin_id>`. Skill-only adapters
//! (`adapter_type = "skill_bundle"`) skip registry operations and only
//! copy declared skills into the OpenClaw skills directory. Status is the
//! read-only `openclaw plugins list` for plugin adapters. All CLI and
//! filesystem operations go through the Manager's helpers — the driver
//! only builds argv arrays from validated data.
//!
//! An adapter may also declare bundled plugins it *displaces*
//! (`[adapters.openclaw].displaces`): plugins whose tool names collide with the
//! adapter's own and which OpenClaw's first-wins tool registry resolves by
//! dropping the adapter's tools. `enable` verifies each declared id against the
//! host's effective inventory and policy before any mutation — a contract naming
//! a plugin this host does not have fails there, rather than after this adapter's
//! own plugin is installed and verified — then disables the ones it may claim,
//! after its own plugin verifies loaded, and records the transition in the
//! receipt;
//! `disable` re-enables exactly what the receipt claims, and steps aside when
//! the exclusive slot the plugin would re-take has since been given to another
//! plugin or explicitly closed (`plugins.slots.<slot> = "none"`) — either way
//! `plugins enable` would re-run OpenClaw's slot selection and undo a choice
//! the operator made after `enable`. A plugin the operator had already turned off
//! before `enable` — by hand, by `plugins.deny`, or by a restrictive
//! `plugins.allow` — is never claimed, so `disable` never re-enables it; and one
//! the host has since dropped or blocked by policy counts as *released* rather
//! than failed, because a restore that can never succeed would otherwise strand
//! the receipt forever with this adapter's own plugin already removed.
//!
//! Displacement is this driver's contract only: the adapter bundle's own
//! `install.sh` / `uninstall.sh` script entry point does not read the
//! declaration and performs no hand-off.
//!
//! Re-enable inherits only the ownership the contract being enabled *now*
//! still declares, and only when the prior receipt was written against the same
//! state directory. A component upgrade that dropped the declaration, replaced
//! the plugin, or moved it to another slot has to take effect, and a fresh probe
//! cannot supply the fact (the plugin is already disabled by this adapter) — but
//! a different `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` is a different registry, where the operator
//! may have disabled the same plugin themselves, and inheriting would claim a
//! choice made in the old home on the strength of a probe that never ran there.
//! Which state directories a prior receipt may name at all is the Manager's trust
//! boundary, not this driver's; the driver only refuses to carry ownership
//! between the ones that survive it.
//! The slot is taken from the current declaration, not from history. Whatever is
//! not inherited is handed back by `cleanup_replaced_claim` — in full, from the
//! prior receipt's own home, when the migration crosses directories — while that
//! receipt is still the durable record of why the plugin was off.
//!
//! Both dry-runs read the receipt, not just the host, and a plan never promises
//! less than the operation does. A re-enable plan reports the displacement the
//! prior receipt carries over instead of what a fresh probe sees (by then the
//! plugin is disabled *by this adapter*, so a probe would promise the opposite
//! of the real lifecycle), and also lists the restore of a displacement the new
//! contract dropped — a mutation `plan_enable` cannot show, since it only walks
//! the current contract, but `cleanup_replaced_claim` really performs first. A
//! disable plan lists the restore a real disable performs, under the same
//! condition the real branch applies, and `validate_claim` rejects on the
//! dry-run path exactly the receipts the real disable would. `status` verifies
//! the displacement too: a bundled plugin re-enabled behind this adapter's back
//! holds the tool names again while every other condition still reads clean, and
//! that reports `False`. A plugin merely *recorded* as disabled reports
//! `Unknown`, because `plugins disable` only writes config and when the running
//! gateway picks that up depends on the host's plugin reload mode — and this
//! driver has no channel to the running gateway, so it cannot tell whether the
//! change has been applied. Guessing "applied" there would make `status` the
//! false all-clear this condition exists to prevent. That verdict is also permanent, and says so: restarting the
//! gateway changes what OpenClaw serves but not what ANOLISA can observe, so the
//! reason points at an actual tool call for confirmation — the only check that
//! travels through the running gateway, named generically because `displaces` is
//! not any one component's contract — and deliberately not at
//! `plugins list` or `plugins inspect`, which read the same persisted state this
//! verdict came from and would hand back a false confirmation before a restart.
//! Nor does it imply a restart will turn `unknown` into `healthy`. Settling it
//! from here needs a gateway tool-catalog channel, which this driver does not
//! have.
//!
//! Every probe about a receipt's own state reads the instance that receipt
//! names — `claim_state_dir(claim)` — not the one the caller's environment
//! happens to point at. `OPENCLAW_HOME` and `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` can both have
//! moved since enable, and the Manager still validates such a receipt, so a
//! status that probed the caller's directory would report on a host this receipt
//! never touched: with `OPENCLAW_HOME=A` retained and `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR=B`
//! overriding it, a B that happens to look clean hides a collision already
//! restored in A.
//!
//! A receipt whose references do not resolve — dangling, mistyped, aimed at
//! this adapter's own plugin or another framework's, duplicated, or naming an
//! empty or twice-claimed exclusive slot — is rejected before the first action
//! of `status` and `disable` alike, not part-way through: `Healthy` would be a
//! report about a plugin the driver cannot name, and a `disable` that noticed
//! only at restore time would already have uninstalled the adapter's own plugin.
//! The slot rules the Manager applies to a contract are re-applied to the
//! receipt, because the receipt is what disable consumes and it can be edited
//! without the contract ever being re-read. For the same reason the driver
//! resolves that own plugin through `OpenClawClaim.plugin_resource` instead of
//! taking the first `FrameworkPlugin` in the resource list — a receipt may
//! legitimately carry two, and their order is nobody's promise.
//!
//! The CLI env contract mirrors `openclaw/scripts/install.sh`: unset
//! `OPENCLAW_HOME`, set `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` to the resolved state directory,
//! and prepend the standard bin dirs to `PATH`. `OPENCLAW_BIN` overrides
//! the executable (used by tests to point at a fake CLI).
//!
//! Before the first framework mutation — during `prepare_enable` (and, for
//! `--dry-run`, `plan_enable`) — `enable` builds a read-only
//! `OpenClawHostProfile` from read-only probes (`openclaw --version`,
//! `plugins install --help`, `plugins enable --help`, `plugins inspect --help`).
//! From it the driver gates on the adapter's declared framework version, chooses
//! version-conditioned config, requires install `--force`, and accepts declared
//! capabilities when each subcommand advertises `--accept-capabilities`. It adds
//! `--dangerously-force-unsafe-install` only when both authorized and
//! advertised as effective by the host, and records the inspect capabilities.
//! The install/verify capabilities flow to `apply_enable` as typed
//! [`PreparedEnable`] state, so
//! apply performs no probe of its own — each probe runs exactly once per
//! enable, all before the first mutation. The host version or argv is never
//! written into the receipt — the receipt stays pure typed data.
