"""Shared fixtures for the V2 policy-CLI end-to-end suite.

These tests drive the real ``agent-sec-cli`` and ``agent-sec-daemon`` binaries over a
Unix domain socket, so they only make sense against an RPM-installed
environment where both binaries are on ``PATH``. A missing binary fails the run
instead of skipping it: skipping would let a broken package slip through the
gate silently.

The suite lives under ``tests/v2/`` rather than ``tests/e2e/`` so the V1
``test-e2e-rpm`` target (which globs ``tests/e2e/``) never collects it.
